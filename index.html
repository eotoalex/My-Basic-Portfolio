    <p id="about-me-info">There is nothing better than an exciting challenge, that tests one's creativity and work-ethic. After watching my old roommate study Objective C a few years back, I began to dabble in Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python, PHP, JSNode and MySQL. I began committing to Github as a way to stay up to pace with these technologies, as I grew more familiar with the communities around them. Helping someone with a coding issue is just as needed as when I need help with my code, so I always try to lend a hand where I can. After all, multiple minds are always better than one confused one.  </p>
