# Portfolio
This is my [portfolio](https://desolate-inlet-61167.herokuapp.com/) site. Here you will find a brief introduction to how I got started in coding and my working knowledge of various web development technologies. This portfolio page also shows off some projects that I have worked on and am currently working on, located on the portfolio link (please be patient when you click on an application, as Heroku's initial start up takes time to wake up.).

# Technologies used include:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* Express
* Sequalize

* NYC Crime Data API

# Current Projects:

I am currently working on an application named Quiggly (labeled as Project 3, to be updated). The app tracks and plots current crime data on a map according to the users current location and calculates a safer route to their destination. These routes are determined by the dangerous locations identified by the crime stats API and the frequency at which criminal activity occurs in a given area. I am working on this route algorithm and also working on API's that update more frequently than the quarterly crime data API that I have found. There is also a news feed that tracks the current news associated to the users location that can be seen flowing across the top of the map.
