# Portfolio
This is a [portfolio](https://desolate-inlet-61167.herokuapp.com/) site that I've been working on, that gives a brief introduction to how I got started in coding and my working knowledge of various web development technologies as well. This portfolio page also shows projects that I have worked on and am currently working on, located on the Portfolio page (please be patient when you click on an application, as Heroku's initial start up takes time to wake up.).

# Technologies used include:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* Express

# Current Projects:

I am currently working on an application named Quiggly (labeled as Project 3, to be updated). The app tracks and plots current crime data on a map for the users current location and calculates a safer route to their destination. These routes are determined by the dangerous locations identified and the frequency at which criminal activity occurs. I am working on this route algorithm and also working on API's that update more frequently than the quarterly crime data API that I have found. There is also a news feed that tracks the current news associated to the users location.
