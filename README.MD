# Current Projects:

I am currently working on an application named Quiggly (labeled as Project 3, to be updated). The app tracks and plots current crime data on a map for the users current location and calculates a safer route to their destination. These routes are determined by the dangerous locations identified and the frequency at which criminal activity occurs. I am working on this route algorithm and also working on API's that update more frequently than the quarterly crime data API that I have found. There is also a news feed that tracks the current news associated to the users location.
